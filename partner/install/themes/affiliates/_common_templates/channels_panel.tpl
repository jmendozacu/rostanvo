##When advertising your affiliate links, you can track them using channels.##<br/>
##To use it, simply create a new channel for every link placement you want. In banners you can choose to get the link version with channel appended.##
##The channel parameter will be transferred also to the tracked commission, so you will know exactly what link led to the commission.##<br/><br/>
##Examples of use##:<br/> 					
1. ##Testing the best placement for the banner on yur website - you can use the same banner, but with different channel for every position - and you will know which one is clicked more or has better CTR.##<br/><br/>
2. ##PPC campaigns - you can have multiple ads for the same affiliate link. By using channel unique for every ad you can find out which ad converts more.##
