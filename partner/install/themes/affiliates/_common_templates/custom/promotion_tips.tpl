<li style="padding: 4px;">
From our experience, you will get the best results from writing your own product reviews, even if it's short. You don't have to be a good writer. Just write what you really think about the product. When you publish your product review, use your general affiliate link (on the top) to send user to our website. 
</li>
<li style="padding: 4px;">
You will have much better conversion if you'll put your visitors into pre-sold mood before sending them to our site. 
Pre-sold mood means that you build interest in product and visitor has decided to potentially buy it after he reads your product review. <br/>
Choose from various types of product descriptions, download and adjust them to fit in your site. Experiment with short or long, try to find perfect combination with banners. 
</li>
<li style="padding: 4px;">
Try to think like a visitor, when he comes to your page with review or affiliate link, you should draw his attention, build curiosity or feeling that he might need this kind of solution. 
</li>
<li style="padding: 4px;">
Experiment with different banners, text links, or reviews. Keep these that bring good results, and change the others. Sometimes only change of few words or color of link can mean difference.
