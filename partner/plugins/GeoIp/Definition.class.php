Free GeoIp database has lower accuracy as paid version offered by MaxMind,
but for most of installations it will be enough,
because in most cases you are interested in country level information and
City level is not so important.

If you want to have more accurate results of IP identification,
you will need to buy GeoCity library from %s and
replace file GeoLiteCity.dat in your plugin directory with one you received from MaxMind.<hr>
